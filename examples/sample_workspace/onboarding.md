# Team Onboarding

## Start in this repo
- Read `README.md` for the workspace purpose.
- Open `deploy.md` for release gates and required checks.
- Open `monitoring.md` to understand incident signals and alerting.
- Open `incidents.md` for response choreography during an issue.

## First week workflow
1. Watch one normal deploy and one rollback.
2. Verify alerts in monitoring for synthetic incidents.
3. Run a cold query like `how do we deploy` and `how do we monitor`.
4. Add notes to `onboarding.md` when onboarding friction appears.

## Cross-file navigation cues
- Every file in this workspace links operations, reliability, and people actions.
- Deploy questions should naturally route to monitoring, and monitoring questions should point back to incident response.
